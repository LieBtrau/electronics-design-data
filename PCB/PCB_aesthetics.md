* When milling is already necessary : round the PCB-corners
* Align components to grid (0.5mm)
* Try to keep things as symmetrical as possible
* Silkscreen
 * Limited use : no designators
 * Mark component polarity (diode, pin 1 of IC)
 * Do not place on bare copper (or vias)
 * Inverted text for pin labels of the connectors
 * True-Type, sans-serif Font : Century Gothic, at least 1.5mm high
 * Serial - number field (so that it can be manually filled in with a felt pen)
 * QC-field (so that it can be checked after validation testing the specific unit)
