    "# Step 0: Antenna design\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "### EMC\n",
    "You can add a ground trace on another layer that covers the traces in order for common mode currents to capacitevely couple to the ground plane.  Do not close the loop of that ground trace, because that would cause eddy currents that short the antenna.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Antenna size\n",
    "* Larger antennas have larger magnetic field strength for the same input power\n",
    "* Maximum coupling is reached when coil radius equals reading distance.\n",
    "* Maximum achievable coupling decreases as antenna size increases.\n",
    "* Larger antennas can generate the minimum field strength (1.5A/m) over longer reading distances, but they require more current to do it.\n",
    "* Minimum antenna size: 500mm² (25mm x 20mm)\n",
    "* Recommended antenna size : 40mm x 40mm\n",
    "* Maximum antenna size: 5000mm² (71mm x 71mm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of turns \n",
    "<img src=\"./inductance_versus_coil_radius.png\" width=\"600px\">\n",
    "Remark that the x-axis is **radius** and not diameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./max_coupling_vs_antenna_size.png\" width=\"600px\">\n",
    "Remark that the x-axis is **diameter** and not radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum coupling is reaced for a coil with a diameter d=4cm (on X-axis), and a reading distance X=2cm.  It's not given what the size of the PICC is, probably something about the same size as the PCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can not increase operating distance by changing the number of turns.\n",
    "* Typical number of turns: 1-4 turns (PN7150: 2-8 turns)\n",
    "* effect on matching circuit : for load modulation (the NFC-card does), more turns are better\n",
    "\n",
    "### Antenna inductance\n",
    "* Antenna inductance: 700nH ~ 1.6μH\n",
    "* Target antenna inductance (for matching) : 1µH → 3µH, best 1µH, L ≈ 300nH up to L≈ 4μH still can be matched properly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Antenna impedance\n",
    "* Antenna matching network R_match should be around 20 - 25 Ohm.  That's a 250mA current for a 5V supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Antenna Q-factor\n",
    "* Q-factor should be around 10-20 for ISO14443 communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Various\n",
    "* Matching circuit should be close to the antenna, not close to the reader.\n",
    "* https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN11755.pdf : ferrite shielding\n",
    "* Minimum track spacing : 0.2mm\n",
    "* Minimum track width : 0.2mm\n",
