[FesZ: EMC tutorials - CM/DM filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZUXPiDt89I)
CM-noise : 
* noise source has high impedance (because of capacitive coupling to PE in case of double insulated equipment) : Pi filter is used to reduce the noise
* 100ohm load impedance of LISN

DM-noise :
* noise source has low source impedance : T filter is used to reduce the noise
* 25ohm load impedance of LISN
