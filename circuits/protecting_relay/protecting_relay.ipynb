    "# Protecting coil-switching device\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When using rectifying diodes without or with zener in anti-series, they should be rated for the coil current.  When the switch opens and the field collapses, the coil current will drop, not rise.\n",
    "2. Use SPD as an alternative (e.g. TVS).  Higher TVS voltage will provide faster switch-off (good for relay contacts) at the expense of higher emissions.\n",
    "3. Use a common package, so that it's easy to replace the SPD by a diode or zener if necessary.\n",
    "4. When placing flyback over the coil, the power supply will have to dissipate the energy.  That may cause a voltage spike on the power supply.  Placing a TVS parallel to the switching device will protect the power supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Protection of relay contacts\n",
    "1. Don't use R/C-snubber over the contacts.  Leakage current through the R/C when the relay is open, will cause dangerous touch currents. Add snubber across the load and across the power supply, both as close to the relay as possible.\n",
    "2. Typical snubber circuit:\n",
    "    * R: 100Ω/2W -> 220Ω/2W : don't use wirewound resistor (too inductive)\n",
    "    * C: 100nF/630V/X2 rated\n",
    "    * MOV : MOV-10D471K : 470V, 2.5kA\n",
