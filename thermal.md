Material property : Thermal conductivity = κ in [ W / (m * K)]

Thermal resistivity = 1 / κ = ρ in [K * m /W]

heat flux [W/m²]
heat flux = thermal conductivity * temperature difference / distance between materials

q = -κ * (T2-T1)/L = -κ * ΔT / L

Sample property (for a certain thickness L and area A):

* Thermal conductance = κ * A / L in [W/K]
* Thermal resistance = 1 / thermal conductance = ρ * L / A = L / (κ * A) in [K/W] = ΔT / (q * A)

Thermal resistance * area = ρ * L in [K * m² / W]
