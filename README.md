# EasyEDA
* A part exists of a unique symbol.  The symbol has a single footprint attached to it.  This is annoying for passive components.  You need to create a symbol for every single resistor.  Cloning an existing symbol speeds up the process.
* There's no way to update parts that have been placed on the schematic.  You have to remove them and place them again.
* Is there a way to update footprints?
* Subparts: package needs to be set in every subpart.
